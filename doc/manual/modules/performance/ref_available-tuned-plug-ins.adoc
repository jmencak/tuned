= Available Tuned plug-ins

This section lists all monitoring and tuning plug-ins currently available in *Tuned*.

[discrete]
== Monitoring plug-ins

Currently, the following monitoring plug-ins are implemented:

`disk`::
Gets disk load (number of IO operations) per device and measurement interval. 

`net`::
Gets network load (number of transferred packets) per network card and measurement interval. 

`load`::
Gets CPU load per CPU and measurement interval. 

[discrete]
== Tuning plug-ins

Currently, the following tuning plug-ins are implemented. Only some of these plug-ins implement dynamic tuning. Options supported by plug-ins are also listed:

`cpu`::
Sets the CPU governor to the value specified by the [option]`governor` option and dynamically changes the Power Management Quality of Service (PM QoS) CPU Direct Memory Access (DMA) latency according to the CPU load.
+
If the CPU load is lower than the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold` option, the latency is set to the value specified by the [option]`latency_high` option, otherwise it is set to the value specified by [option]`latency_low`.
+
You can also force the latency to a specific value and prevent it from dynamically changing further. To do so, set the [option]`force_latency` option to the required latency value. 

`eeepc_she`::
Dynamically sets the front-side bus (FSB) speed according to the CPU load. 
+
This feature can be found on some netbooks and is also known as the ASUS Super Hybrid Engine (SHE).
+
If the CPU load is lower or equal to the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold_powersave` option, the plug-in sets the FSB speed to the value specified by the [option]`she_powersave` option. If the CPU load is higher or equal to the value specified by the [option]`load_threshold_normal` option, it sets the FSB speed to the value specified by the [option]`she_normal` option. 
+
Static tuning is not supported and the plug-in is transparently disabled if *Tuned* does not detect the hardware support for this feature. 

`net`::
Configures the Wake-on-LAN functionality to the values specified by the [option]`wake_on_lan` option. It uses the same syntax as the `ethtool` utility. It also dynamically changes the interface speed according to the interface utilization. 

`sysctl`::
Sets various `sysctl` settings specified by the plug-in options.
+
The syntax is ``[replaceable]__name__=[replaceable]__value__``, where [replaceable]_name_ is the same as the name provided by the `sysctl` utility.
+
Use the `sysctl` plug-in if you need to change system settings that are not covered by other plug-ins available in *Tuned*. If the settings are covered by some specific plug-ins, prefer these plug-ins.

`usb`::
Sets autosuspend timeout of USB devices to the value specified by the [option]`autosuspend` parameter. 
+
The value `0` means that autosuspend is disabled. 

`vm`::
Enables or disables transparent huge pages depending on the Boolean value of the [option]`transparent_hugepages` option.

`audio`::
Sets the autosuspend timeout for audio codecs to the value specified by the [option]`timeout` option.
+
Currently, the `snd_hda_intel` and `snd_ac97_codec` codecs are supported. The value `0` means that the autosuspend is disabled. You can also enforce the controller reset by setting the Boolean option [option]`reset_controller` to `true`. 

`disk`::
Sets the disk elevator to the value specified by the [option]`elevator` option.
+
It also sets:
+
--
* APM to the value specified by the [option]`apm` option
* Scheduler quantum to the value specified by the [option]`scheduler_quantum` option
* Disk spindown timeout to the value specified by the [option]`spindown` option
* Disk readahead to the value specified by the [option]`readahead` parameter
* The current disk readahead to a value multiplied by the constant specified by the [option]`readahead_multiply` option
--
+
In addition, this plug-in dynamically changes the advanced power management and spindown timeout setting for the drive according to the current drive utilization. The dynamic tuning can be controlled by the Boolean option [option]`dynamic` and is enabled by default. 

`scsi_host`::
Tunes options for SCSI hosts.
+
It sets Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPM) to the value specified by the [option]`alpm` option.

`mounts`::
Enables or disables barriers for mounts according to the Boolean value of the [option]`disable_barriers` option. 

`script`::
Executes an external script or binary when the profile is loaded or unloaded. You can choose an arbitrary executable.
+
IMPORTANT: The `script` plug-in is provided mainly for compatibility with earlier releases. Prefer other *Tuned* plug-ins if they cover the required functionality. 
+
*Tuned* calls the executable with one of the following arguments:
+
--
** `start` when loading the profile
** `stop` when unloading the profile
--
+
You need to correctly implement the `stop` action in your executable and revert all settings that you changed during the `start` action. Otherwise, the roll-back step after changing your *Tuned* profile will not work. 
+
Bash scripts can import the [filename]`/usr/lib/tuned/functions` Bash library and use the functions defined there. Use these functions only for functionality that is not natively provided by *Tuned*. If a function name starts with an underscore, such as `_wifi_set_power_level`, consider the function private and do not use it in your scripts, because it might change in the future.
+
Specify the path to the executable using the `script` parameter in the plug-in configuration.
+
.Running a Bash script from a profile
====
To run a Bash script named `script.sh` that is located in the profile directory, use:

----
[script]
script=${i:PROFILE_DIR}/script.sh
----
====

`sysfs`::
Sets various `sysfs` settings specified by the plug-in options.
+
The syntax is ``[replaceable]__name__=[replaceable]__value__``, where [replaceable]_name_ is the `sysfs` path to use. 
+
Use this plugin in case you need to change some settings that are not covered by other plug-ins. Prefer specific plug-ins if they cover the required settings.

`video`::
Sets various powersave levels on video cards. Currently, only the Radeon cards are supported.
+
The powersave level can be specified by using the [option]`radeon_powersave` option. Supported values are: 
+
--
* `default`
* `auto`
* `low`
* `mid`
* `high`
* `dynpm`
* `dpm-battery`
* `dpm-balanced`
* `dpm-perfomance`
--
+
For details, see link:http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature#KMS_Power_Management_Options[www.x.org]. Note that this plug-in is experimental and the option might change in future releases. 

`bootloader`::
Adds options to the kernel command line. This plug-in supports only the GRUB 2 boot loader.
+
Customized non-standard location of the GRUB 2 configuration file can be specified by the [option]`grub2_cfg_file` option.
+
The kernel options are added to the current GRUB configuration and its templates. The system needs to be rebooted for the kernel options to take effect.
+
Switching to another profile or manually stopping the `tuned` service removes the additional options. If you shut down or reboot the system, the kernel options persist in the [filename]`grub.cfg` file.
+
The kernel options can be specified by the following syntax:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
cmdline=[replaceable]_arg1_ [replaceable]_arg2_ ... [replaceable]_argN_
----
+
--
.Modifying the kernel command line
====
For example, to add the [option]`quiet` kernel option to a *Tuned* profile, include the following lines in the [filename]`tuned.conf` file:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline=quiet
----

The following is an example of a custom profile that adds the [option]`isolcpus=2` option to the kernel command line:

----
[bootloader]
cmdline=isolcpus=2
----

====

`rtentsk`::
Opens a socket, enables timestamping on it and keeps the socket open for the lifetime of the `tuned` process.
The rationale is to eliminate inter-processor interrupts caused by processes enabling/disabling the
timestamping socket option resulting in `static_key_enable`/`static_key_disable` kernel functions calls.
